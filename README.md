# Asynchronous-Multiplayer-tic-tac-toe-game-
I have successfully implemented my asynchronous multiplayer tic-tac-toe-game using React.Js as frontend and Node.Js as backend development
To build an asynchronous multi-player Tic Tac Toe game, you will need to implement the following:

1.Mobile web frontend:
a.Create the UI for the Tic Tac Toe game, including the game board, player displays, and any other necessary UI elements.
b.Implement the game logic for allowing players to take turns, checking for wins or draws, and displaying the results.
c.Use JavaScript and a framework such as React to build the frontend.

2.API backend:
a.Design and implement an API for managing game state, including creating and joining games, making moves, and checking for wins or draws.
b.Use a language such as Node.Js to build the backend.
c.Connect the backend to a database to store game state, player information, and any other necessary data.


3.Asynchronous communication:
a.Use websockets or some other real-time communication technology to enable the frontend and backend to communicate asynchronously.
b.This will allow players to take turns in real-time, without the need for constant polling or refresh.
c.Overall, building an asynchronous multi-player Tic Tac Toe game will require a combination of frontend and backend development skills, as well as some understanding of real-time communication technologies.
